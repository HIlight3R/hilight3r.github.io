The last 2 of those years were in an IT-specialized class. As a result, I scored 276 points on the Unified State Exam, with 98 in computer science, which gave me a significant advantage when applying to university. University 2024 ~ now @ RTU MIREA Currently, I am studying at RTU MIREA in the bachelor's program \"Software Engineering\" with a specialization in \"Software Product Development and Information Systems Design\". The studies are relatively easy, and I have enough time to work on my projects. Additional education: Java. Basic course 2021 @ Computer Science Center This was where my first serious acquaintance with programming began. I got acquainted with the basics of Java and OOP, which gave me a significant boost in understanding programming as a whole. Link to certificate Python Pro 2023 @ University 2035 By participating in this program for future Python developers, I significantly improved my knowledge of the language and its frameworks. Link to certificate Self-education 2024 ~ now @ Internet I consider this step no less important than any other. It is through self-study that one can acquire new knowledge faster, cheaper, and more effectively than any courses. My projects # HIlight3R/Dominator Discord-bot for moderation and fun.
