The last 5 years of my academic life I spent at the Bauman Engineering School, where I received an excellent foundation
for further studies. The last 2 of those years were in an IT-specialized class. As a result, I scored 276 points on the
Unified State Exam, with 98 in computer science, which gave me a significant advantage when applying to university.

Currently, I am studying at RTU MIREA in the bachelor's program "Software Engineering" with a specialization in
"Software Product Development and Information Systems Design". The studies are relatively easy, and I have enough time
to work on my projects.

{{< timelineItem icon="check" header="Java. Basic course" subheader="@ Computer Science Center" badge="2021" >}}
This was where my first serious acquaintance with programming began. I got acquainted with the basics of Java and OOP,
which gave me a significant boost in understanding programming as a whole.

{{< timelineItem icon="check" header="Python Pro" subheader="@ University 2035" badge="2023" >}}
By participating in this program for future Python developers, I significantly improved my knowledge of the language and
its frameworks.

I consider this step no less important than any other. It is through self-study that one can acquire new knowledge
faster, cheaper, and more effectively than any courses.
